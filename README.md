# Wikipedia-Continual-Learning-RAG
This repository implements a self-updating RAG (Retrograde Autoregressive Generation) model. It leverages Wikipedia for factual grounding and can fine-tune itself when information is unavailable. This allows the model to continually learn and adapt, offering a dynamic and informative response.
